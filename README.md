This is primarily a tracking issue for myself with the intent to add packages not yet included from PortableApps, make sure they use static installer links, ensure the right installer types are being used, and include as much information possible in the manifests (such as descriptions, tags, cli names, etc.). I will avoid unsupported or EOL releases.
